## About CorvallisALT

CorvallisALT is a centralized web resource for tracking local music events in and around Corvallis, Oregon. 

The intention behind this project is 
to create a place where bands can advertise their upcoming shows and audience members can keep tabs on where their favorite bands are playing without having
to turn to a large social media company.
